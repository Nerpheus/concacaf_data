Competitition: Canadian Professional Soccer League
Season: 1983

*This was Canada's first real attempt at establishing a truly national professional soccer league. The league would use FIFA rules (unlike the concurrent NASL). Teams were limited to just five imported players per squad. The rest of the players were Canadian. The league was started in 1983, but folded after the inaugural season, durin which two of the six entrants folded (one of them twice).
